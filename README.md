## Architecture

### Core Components

### **Monitoring Stack**
- **Prometheus**: Prometheus scrapes the /metrics endpoint offered by vLLM. It can store metrics itself in its own time-series database on a local disk which is
                  highly optimized for fast queries on recent data. This is perfect for real-time monitoring and alerting but is not
                  ideal for long term and multi-year storage. This is where Thanos Querier comes in.
- **Thanos Querier**: Extends Prometheus by solving the problem of long-term retention. Thanos is capable of taking data blocks that Prometheus saves to
                      its local disk and uploading them to inexpensive and durable object storage, like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
                      Querier gives you a cost-effective way of retaining years of metrics data available for historical analysis and trend reporting.
                      Querier sidecars run alongside your Prometheus servers, providing access to real-time and recent metrics.                  
- **DCGM**: GPU monitoring and telemetry
- **Streamlit UI**: Multi-dashboard interface (vLLM, OpenShift, Chat)
- **FastAPI Backend**: metrics-api for web UI and report generation
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for AI assistant integration
- **Report Generator**: PDF/HTML/Markdown export capabilities
- **llm-service:** LLM inference (Llama models)
- **llama-stack:** Backend API
- **vLLM:** Model serving, exports Prometheus /metrics
- **Prometheus/Thanos:** Metrics scraping, long-term storage
- **DCGM:** GPU monitoring
- **Streamlit UI:** Multi-dashboard frontend
- **MCP:** Metric Collection & Processing backend
- **Report Generator:** PDF/HTML/Markdown export

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster with GPU nodes (for DCGM metrics)
- `oc` CLI with cluster-admin permissions
- `helm` v3.x
- `yq` (YAML processor)
- Deployed Prometheus/Thanos
- Operators for distributed tracing
  - Red Hat Build of OpenTelemetry Operator
  - Tempo Operator
  - Cluster Observability Operator
- (Optional) DCGM exporter for GPU monitoring
- (Optional) Slack Webhook URL for alerting ([How to create a Webhook for your Slack Workspace](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks))


### Installing the OpenShift AI Observability Summarizer

Use the included `Makefile` to install everything:
```bash
make install NAMESPACE=your-namespace
```
This will install the project with the default LLM deployment, `llama-3-2-3b-instruct`.

### Using an Existing Model

To use an existing model instead of deploying a new one, specify `LLM_URL` as the model service URL:

```bash
# URL with port (no processing applied)
make install LLM_URL=http://llama-3-2-3b-instruct-predictor.dev.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1 NAMESPACE=your-namespace

# URL without port (automatically adds :8080/v1)
make install LLM_URL=http://llama-3-2-3b-instruct-predictor.dev.svc.cluster.local NAMESPACE=your-namespace
```

**URL Processing**: If the `LLM_URL` doesn't contain a port (`:PORT` format), the system will automatically append `:8080/v1` to the URL. This simplifies configuration while maintaining flexibility for custom ports.

**Token Management**: When `LLM_URL` is specified, the system will not prompt for a Hugging Face token since you're using an existing model that doesn't require new model deployment.

This is useful when:
- You already have a model deployed in your cluster
- You want to share a model across multiple namespaces
- You prefer not to deploy redundant model instances
- You want to avoid unnecessary token prompts for external models

### Choosing different models

To see all available models:
```bash
make list-models
```
```
(Output)
model: llama-3-1-8b-instruct (meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
model: llama-3-2-1b-instruct (meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct)
model: llama-3-2-1b-instruct-quantized (RedHatAI/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-quantized.w8a8)
model: llama-3-2-3b-instruct (meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct)
model: llama-3-3-70b-instruct (meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct)
model: llama-guard-3-1b (meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-1B)
model: llama-guard-3-8b (meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B)
```
You can use the `LLM` flag during installation to set a model from this list for deployment:
```
make install NAMESPACE=your-namespace LLM=llama-3-2-3b-instruct 
```

### With GPU tolerations
```bash
make install NAMESPACE=your-namespace LLM=llama-3-2-3b-instruct LLM_TOLERATION="nvidia.com/gpu"
```

### With safety models
```bash
make install NAMESPACE=your-namespace \
  LLM=llama-3-2-3b-instruct LLM_TOLERATION="nvidia.com/gpu" \
  SAFETY=llama-guard-3-8b SAFETY_TOLERATION="nvidia.com/gpu"
```

### With alerting
```bash
make install NAMESPACE=your-namespace ALERTS=TRUE
```
Enabling alerting will deploy alert rules, a cron job to monitor vLLM metrics, and AI-powered Slack notifications.

### Accessing the Application

The default configuration deploys:
- **llm-service** - LLM inference 
- **llama-stack** - Backend API
- **pgvector** - Vector database
- **metric-mcp** - Metrics collection & processing API
- **metric-ui** - Multi-dashboard Streamlit interface

## Build & Deploy

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile that simplifies building, pushing, and deploying the application components.

### Building and Pushing Container Images

The application consists of multiple services that need to be built as container images for OpenShift deployment.

#### **Build All Images**

```bash
# Build all container images (metrics-api, metric-ui, metric-alerting)
make build

# Build with custom tag
make build TAG=v1.0.0

# Build with custom registry
make build REGISTRY=your-registry.com/your-org
```

#### **Build Individual Components**

```bash
# Build FastAPI Backend (metrics-api)
make build-metrics-api

# Build Streamlit UI (metric-ui)
make build-ui

# Build Alerting Service (metric-alerting)
make build-alerting
```

#### **Push Images to Registry**

```bash
# Push all images to registry
make push

# Push with custom tag
make push TAG=v1.0.0

# Push individual components
make push-metrics-api
make push-ui
make push-alerting
```

#### **Complete Build and Push Workflow**

```bash
# Build and push all images in one command
make build-and-push

# With custom configuration
make build-and-push TAG=v1.0.0 REGISTRY=your-registry.com/your-org
```

### Deploy to OpenShift

#### **Basic Deployment**

```bash
# Deploy to OpenShift namespace
make deploy NAMESPACE=your-namespace

# Deploy with alerting enabled
make deploy-with-alerts NAMESPACE=your-namespace
```

#### **Complete Build, Push, and Deploy Workflow**

```bash
# Complete workflow: build → push → deploy
make build-deploy NAMESPACE=your-namespace

# Complete workflow with alerting
make build-deploy-alerts NAMESPACE=your-namespace
```

#### **Deployment Management**

```bash
# Check deployment status
make status NAMESPACE=your-namespace

# Uninstall deployment
make uninstall NAMESPACE=your-namespace
```

### Configuration Options

The Makefile supports various configuration options via environment variables:

```bash
# Set custom registry
export REGISTRY=your-registry.com/your-org

# Set custom tag
export TAG=v1.0.0

# Set target platform
export PLATFORM=linux/amd64

# Show current configuration
make config
```

### Local Development

For local development with port-forwarding:

```bash
# Set up local development environment
make install-local NAMESPACE=your-namespace

# If model is in different namespace
make install-local NAMESPACE=default-ns MODEL_NAMESPACE=model-ns
```

This will run the `./scripts/local-dev.sh` script to set up port-forwarding to Llamastack, llm-service, and Thanos.

### Available Models

```bash
# List available models for deployment
make list-models
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Clean up local images
make clean
```


## Local Development via Port-Forwarding

For local development of the metrics API/UI and MCP server, use the unified development environment script that handles port-forwarding to Llamastack, LLM service, and Thanos.

**Pre-requisites**:
1. You have a deployment on the cluster already.
2. You are logged into the cluster and can execute `oc` commands against the cluster.

### Quick Setup with Makefile

The easiest way to set up local development is using the Makefile:

```bash
# Set up local development environment
make install-local NAMESPACE=your-namespace
```

This will run the `./scripts/local-dev.sh` script automatically.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run the script manually, follow these steps:

1. **Make sure you are logged into the cluster and can execute `oc` commands against the cluster.**
2. Install `uv` by following instructions on the [uv website](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
3. Sync up the environment and development dependencies using `uv` in the base directory:
### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Setup environment
uv sync --group dev
# Note: Virtual environment activation is handled automatically by the script

# 2. Start development environment (includes all port forwarding)
./scripts/local-dev.sh -n <DEFAULT_NAMESPACE>

# 3. If model is in different namespace (optional)
./scripts/local-dev.sh -n <DEFAULT_NAMESPACE> -m <MODEL_NAMESPACE>
```

### What the script does:
- ✅ **Activates Python virtual environment** (.venv)
- ✅ **Port forwards Prometheus/Thanos** (localhost:9090)
- ✅ **Port forwards LLM server** (localhost:8321) 
- ✅ **Port forwards Model service** (localhost:8080)
- ✅ **Starts metrics API** (localhost:8000)
- ✅ **Starts Streamlit UI** (localhost:8501)
- ✅ **Configures environment** for MCP server development

### For MCP/AI Assistant Development
After running `scripts/local-dev.sh`, you can:

```bash
# Configure AI assistants (Claude Desktop + Cursor IDE)
cd src/mcp_server
python setup_integration.py

# Test MCP server
obs-mcp-server --test-config
```

The output should look like this:
![Command Output](docs/img/local-dev-expected.png)

#### Macos weasyprint install

**Still verifying whether we need this setup or not as weasyprint is installed using `uv` in previous step.**

In order to run the metrics API locally you'll need to install weasyprint:
1. Install via brew `brew install weasyprint`
2. Ensure installation `weasyprint --version`
3. Set **DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH** `export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib:$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`

## Running Tests with Pytest

The test suite is located in the `tests/` directory, with the tests for each service in their respective directories.

1. Using `uv`, sync up the test dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv sync --group test
```

2. Use the `pytest` command go run all tests

```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output and coverage
uv run pytest -v --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run only MCP tests
uv run pytest -v tests/mcp/

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest -v tests/mcp/test_api_endpoints.py
```

To view a detailed coverage report after generating, open `htmlcov/index.html`.

## Semantic Versioning

This project uses automated semantic versioning based on PR labels, PR titles, and commit message conventions. Version bumps are determined by analyzing PRs in order of priority when merged.

### Version Bump Priority Order
1. **PR Labels** (highest priority) - Add labels like `major`, `feature`, `bugfix`
2. **PR Title** (medium priority) - Use conventional commit format in PR title
3. **Commit Messages** (fallback) - Traditional commit message analysis

### Version Bump Rules
- **Major (`X`.0.0)**: Breaking changes - Keywords: `BREAKING CHANGE:`, `BREAKING CHANGE` (colon optional), `breaking:`, `!:`, `major:`
- **Minor (X.`Y`.0)**: New features - Keywords: `feat:`, `feature:`, `add:`, `minor:`
- **Patch (X.Y.`Z`)**: Bug fixes and other changes - Keywords: `patch`, `bugfix`, `fix`, `documentation` (no colons)

### Quick Examples
```bash
# Recommended: Use PR labels
PR with label "feature:" → Minor bump
PR with label "bugfix" → Patch bump
PR with label "major:" → Major bump

# Alternative: Use PR title
"feat: add user authentication" → Minor bump
"fix: resolve login timeout" → Patch bump  
"refactor!: redesign API endpoints" → Major bump
```
